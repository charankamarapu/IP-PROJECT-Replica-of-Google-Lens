### INTRODUCTION
This is a handwritten text detection algorithm using Image processing and deep learning.\
check out my video for total explanation.\

AIM: To enhance the unclear handwritten text or scanned books into an editable format like documents, pdfs etc.\

Input/Source: The source or input of this project will be an unclear/improperly scanned/    blurred handwritten text or scanned books which may have different kinds of noise.\

Image Enhancement and detection:
- Performing different filtering methods to eliminate the noise and enhance a clear image of the text for further processing. 
- Pre-processed image will undergo line segmentation then to word segmentation and at last to character segmentation.
- The received character will then be processed for feature extraction, classification and detection in different ways either using structural and statistical features extraction or using OCR or Neural networks.
- Recognized characters are integrated to form required text.

Output/Result: The output will be an editable text document or pdf.
